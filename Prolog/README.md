# Prolog
- Problem to solve: labirinto
- Implemented algorithms: Iterative Deepening, Iterative deepening A\*, A\*
- How to run `start.py`: 
```bash
./start.py labirinth_name
```
The script runs all the algorithms on the maze passed as a parameter, listing the execution times.
- How to run `setup.py`:
```bash
./setup.py algo_name
```
The script creates the folder and files for automatic execution.
- How to run `test.py`
```bash
./test.py number_of_labirinths
```
The script creates random mazes using `generate.py` and` translate.py`, and runs all the algorithms on them.
With *number_of_Labirinths* you specify with how many mazes to test the algorithms.
